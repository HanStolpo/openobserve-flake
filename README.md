# A Nix Flake to build OpenObserve

This Flake provides a Nix package for the observability platform [OpenObserve](https://openobserve.ai) which can be
useful if you want to run it in a local Nix base development environment.

OpenObserve it self is covered by the [AGPL3](https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/blob/main/LICENSE) and any use
of it is covered by that license.
